Drone Technology 
Drones can be utilised by Regen Tech to take aerial photographs of client’s farms. Additionally, drones technology is relatively inexpensive and can be flown with little to no experience, thus eliminating the need for an expensive helicopter, maintenance, fuel and pilot costs. 


Advantages
* Low capital investment 
* Drone solution can be deployed immediately
* Little to no experience need to fly the drone
* Licencing is inexpensive


Disadvantages
* Pilot error due to inexperience
* An accident could destroy the drone and/or the photography equipment attached to it. 
* Regulation - Requires a licence for commercial use and certificate of accreditation for the pilot


Impacts
Implementing a drone strategy would positively impact Regen Tech.  Decommissioning the helicopter solution would be a net gain financially for the company as it is extremely expensive to maintain. Additionally the company can reinvest the proceeds from the sale of the helicopter to purchase a number of drones and pay for the regulatory costs as mentioned above, with funds left over. 




Augment Reality
AR technology can be used to show prospective client’s what their technology will look like on their property, without the need for setting up infrastructure. There is no cost in using or learning the technology besides the initial setup and purchase cost. 




Advantages
* relatively in expensive - only pay for initial cost and maintenance 
* Scales with no additional cost 
* Easily deployed on a tablet or smartphone 
* Does not require training 
* Easily communicated/sent as it is digital
* Requires no regulatory oversight or considerations


Disadvantages 
* Clients may be hesitant or distrustful of the technology 
* Imagery may look slightly different to the physical infrastructure 


Impacts 
Implementing an AR strategy would positively impact Regen Tech.  Regen Tech does not need to get rid of their old technology and can use AR to reach more clients and supplement their current tech stack. Most importantly, as the content is digital, it scales with no further cost to Regen Tech. 


Artificial Intelligence
AI functionality can be used by Regen Tech to automate costly, time consuming and often redundant manual data analysing and visualisation. 


Advantages
* Scales infinitely 
* Cheap and inexpensive on-going cost
* Reduces time taken and costs associated with manual data calculation
* No regulatory considerations


Disadvantages 
* May require expert to set up and implement solution
* May require staff training on how to use
* May require time once implemented for the AI to gather enough data


Impacts
Implementing an AI strategy would positively impact Regen Tech as it would free up staff to do other things instead of manually executing the above task. The cost and hurdles associated with implementing this technology is low. The cost of removing the old solution raises an ethical dilemma if the staff members manually analysing the data cannot be repurposed within the organisation. If staff are laid off because of the addition of this solution, it may hurt morale.
