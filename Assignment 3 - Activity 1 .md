Activity 1 


Discovery
In researching and writing my emerging technology report, I have cited a number of sources including leading industry players such as, the Australian Computer Society and IBM as well as technology and business media company Business Insider. This ensures a well rounded mix of technical and lay information. 


What is drone technology? 
A drone, also known as an unmanned autonomous vehicle (UAV), is a robotic technology that enables the user to fly a pilotless aircraft remotely[1].  Drone technology has a vast number of applications including in the commercial, industrial and military sectors[2]. 


How can  drone technology practices be applied by Regen Tech? 
Rengen Tech is currently making use of helicopters to take aerial images of their clients' farms. This endeavour is extremely expensive and labour intensive. Using drone technology for aerial imagery rather than a helicopter will dramatically reduce the cost of this component. It will also allow them to survey potential client’s farms to show them a proof of concept with minimal costs. 


What is Augmented Reality? 
Augmented reality, better known by its acronym AR, is a multimedia experience in which digital content is superimposed over a physical environment in real time, allowing the user to purposefully interact with the digital content[3]. 


How does it apply to Rengen Tech? 
Rengen Tech can utilise Augmented Reality technology to show prospective client’s what their technology can look like on their property by overlaying the Rengen Tech infrastructure over the aerial images. 


What is AI - Artificial intelligence
Artificial intelligence, better known by its acronym AI, is the application of computer science and engineering in order to replicate facets of human intelligence, such as pattern recognition,  data processing, logic and cognition[4],.  In other words, Artificial intelligence utilises the computing power of machines, computer programs and vast amounts of information  in order to solve complex problems similarly as a human being would. The difference being, however, is that computers can store, access and compute data on a scale much larger than the human brain and this is what makes this emerging technology so exciting[5]. 


How can  Artificial Intelligence practices be applied by Regen Tech? 
Regen Tech can apply Artificial Intelligence practices in a number of ways, but particularly in the area of automating the manual task of analyzing, and presenting meaningful data collected from their clients. Using AI for this component would dramatically reduce the time, energy and cost of this operational component.
