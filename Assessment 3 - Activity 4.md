Activity 4


The drone, AR & AI tech stack as identified in the Regen Tech Technology Impact Report has the potential to revolutionise Regen Tech’s core business and increase the company’s effectiveness in the agricultural arena. And while the current tech stack has served Regen Tech well, the company is at risk of being left behind as new technology and efficiencies are adopted throughout the agribusiness sector. The great news is as technology is naturally deflationary, so as time goes on the new technology stack will become cheaper and more powerful.  


The good news is that by selling some of Regen Tech’s assets, namely the helicopter and associated property, the company can fund the implementation of all the technology identified in the Impact Report due to the marginal costs associated with drone, AR and AI technology. Moreover, as the technology is so inexpensive Regen Tech will have funds left over which it can reinvest back into its business. 


The sale of the helicopter should begin as soon as possible. This will allow for Regen Tech to purchase suitable drone and photography equipment as well as pay for the licensing,  accreditation of the drone pilot, insurance and even a training course if deemed necessary. This will immediately reduce the company’s on-going costs moving forward as it will no longer need to pay for expensive fuel, maintenance and other costs associated with the helicopter. Additionally, as the drone is natively compatible with the photography equipment, the pilot can literally film exactly what is needed, reducing the amount of time spent editing the photos and videos. 


The next step of the process is to implement AR technology into the business and digitise the short course. This will assist with communicating how the company’s proposed improvements would look for custom farm plans by allowing prospective farmers to learn and interact with their plans in their own time and on their own farms, reducing the requirement for the farmers to be on site for the free short course which is currently 1-3 days. This initiative alone increases Regen Tech’s reach and allows you to contact farmers who have previously been interested in the solutions you offer, but couldn’t come to agreement due to the inability to come onsite. 


The final step of the plan is to implement AI into the company and remove the need for manual data processing and data entry. By introducing AI into this aspect of the business, the company can automate simple statistics useful to farmers such as totals, maximums, minimums, and averages. Additionally, as this technology is digitally native, we simply email all the information to the client, avoiding delays and solving the problem of the farmers receiving the mailed letters several weeks later. 


Skynet Research knows that sometimes things don’t go to plan, so if at any point there is an issue with the above implementation, we will assess the failings of our Strategic and Impact reports with an eye to review exactly what went wrong, and how we can change or implement new processes, procedures or technology to ameliorate the situation. Key to evaluating this will be the feedback received from employees and clients alike, so we have also set up a system for Regen Tech to accept and document any feedback so changes can be made as needed.Activity 4

Finally, it is with great pleasure to announce that our technology stratergy can be implemented right away without any trials due to the low cost and easy to manage and use technology.
